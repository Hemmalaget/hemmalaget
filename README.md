Hemmalaget
==========

A static homepage for Hemmalaget AB, built with React, Express, Webpack and hosted on Heroku.


## Design goal

The repository architecture is optimized for infrequent edits over a long lifetime. This leads to a number of design goals:

* Use standardized languages and tools with long-term relevancy and support.
* Modularize and limit the relevant context knowledge necessary to make changes.

Furthermore, the site's user base consists of people with various degrees of ability which necessitates special attention:

* Make sure usability and clarity is high and that tools such as screen readers and keyboard navigation are well supported.


## Architecture

The website is built around a handful tools and frameworks:

1. **React** - for defining modular web components
2. **Webpack** - for managing the build process
3. **Express** - for serving the app in production
4. **Node** - underlying runtime for development tools
5. **webpack-dev-server** - for serving the app in development
6. **Heroku** - for hosting the website
7. **Github** - for hosting the git repository

The actual website code is contained in the `app/`-directory. Files on the first level pertains to the application as a whole and includes entrypoints and global layout and styles. Specifically, `app.js` defines the main React component that's mounted into `index.html`. Moreover, `common.css` defines a couple of variables and style-mixins that are used across the codebase.

The next level splits the components into `sections/` - meant to be a standalone part of `app.js` - and `components/` - meant to be used as part of sections and other components. Each subfolder within defines their own module which is supposed to be as disconnected as possible with dependencies explicitly defined.

Each module is responsible for its own assets, notably including it's own css. This project makes use of Webpack's `css-loader` module-feature, meaning styles are local to a given element and its children allowing for fully modular css.


## Requirements

1. Node
2. Yarn
3. Git
4. Heroku toolbelt

I won't go into installation instructions as there's plenty of more up-to-date information about this online already.


## Development

The below commands will install dependencies, start a development server with hot reload and finally open a tab in your web browser of choice.

```bash
yarn start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Most changes to the code should be instantaneously and automatically updated in your browser, but you might occasionally need to reload manually after errors.


## Testing

As this is a static webpage, there's not a lot of behavior to test. However, some end-to-end tests and linting are planned for a future release.


## Deployment

The website is *automatically deployed whenever a new version of the `master` branch is pushed to Github*.

You can test the deployment scripts locally if you'd like:

```bash
# Build an optimized bundle and images to dist/
yarn run build

# Start a local server mimicking an actual deploy to Heroku
heroku local
```
